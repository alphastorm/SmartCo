The Smart Company shall indemnify any person who was or is a party defendant or is threatened to be made a party defendant, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Smart Company) by reason of the fact that they are or were a Member of the Smart Company, manager, employee, or agent of the Smart Company, or are or were serving at the request of the Smart Company, against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the Members determine that they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Smart Company, and with respect to any criminal action proceeding, have no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of "no lo Contendere" or its equivalent, shall not in itself create a presumption that the person did or did not act in good faith and in a manner which they reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Smart Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was lawful.

**4.2 Fiduciary Duties**.

No Manager shall be personally liable to the Smart Company or its Members for any action undertaken or omitted in good faith reliance upon the provisions of this Agreement, and the Smart Company shall indemnify such Managers for the same, unless the acts or omissions of the Manager were not in good faith or involved criminal activity, willful misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation or breach of this Agreement; provided, however, that each Manager shall owe, and shall act in a manner consistent with, fiduciary duties to the Smart Company and its Members of the nature, and to the same extent, as those owed by directors of a Delaware corporation. Additionally, the Smart Company may provide additional liability protection by entering into individual indemnification contracts with Managers.
